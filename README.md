# baytek_hackathon_mobile
This is a iOS mobile application that takes data from a baytek machine and uploads it to a rails back-end. That back-end code is called VendingMachineTrackerApp and the repo is found under my github account

# This project and it's back-end where done by me and my brother Jim DiZoglio at the Baytek hackathon on 02-28-15

We didn't submit be thought it was a useful application to upload to github if a baytek
operator needs a back-end and mobile client to collect data. It requires the Dquid board
to work.
